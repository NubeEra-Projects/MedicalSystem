### Process for creating an EC2 instance :
**CREATING AN EC2 INSTANCE** <br>


**Step 1**: First, login into your AWS account and click on “services” <br>
                                                                         
**Step 2**: From the drop-down menu of options, tap on “EC2 " <br>

**Step 3**: For Creating an Instance we first need to create a "KEY PAIR " <br>

1. Under Resources click-on Key pairs <br>
2. Now Create a new keypair by clicking on "create key pair " at the top right of the section <br>
3. Now enter the key pair name , select key pair type to RSA or ED25519 respectively <br>
4. Now selectthe private key type as .pem or .ppk according to your working enviornment <br>
5. Now Finally click-on create keypair <br>
                                          
**Step 4**: After successfully creating a keypair we now need to create a security group <br>

   1. Under the Resources click-on Security Groups <br>
   2.  We already have an existing security group ie: the default security group but for our requirements we well create new one
   3. So now Create a new security group by clicking on "create security group " <br>
   4. Fill in the security group name , description , vpc info and then add inbound rules to it <br>
   5. Select in-bound rules and add a new rule with type as "All Traffic" and source as "IPV4" <br>
   6. Click-on create security group <br>
   
**Step 5**: Now for creating an instance <br>

   1. Click on instance under the resources section <br>
   2. Click on launch instance ,  after clicking on it you will be redirected to a launch page where we can create instance
   3. Create a name for the instance <br>
   4. Select AMI – Required operating system from the available. <br>
   5. I am selecting Ubuntu AMI as we need to create Ubuntu instance. By default, it selects a free tier storage. <br>
   6. Select instance type <br>
       By default, instance type is “t2.micro” which is free tier eligible service. <br>
       Do not select any other which leads to billing amount. <br>
   7. Now Select the key pair which me made earlier . <br>
   8. In the network setting Select to existing security group and under that 
      select the Security group which we had prepared earlier . <br>
   9. Click on launch the instance <br>
   
**Step 6**: After Launching the instance right click-on the instance and select the option connect <br>

**Step 7**: It automatically takes us to "Connect to Instance" page <br>

**Step 8**: Now here select "Connect to EC2 instance connect" <br>

**Step 9**: Click on Connect <br>

**Step 10**: We get re-directed to a new page in which we now have the terminal <br

**Step 11**: Connecting Sql using EC2 instance Connect
